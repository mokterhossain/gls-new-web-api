The majority of asbestos testing labs in Canada are non-accredited and are non-compliant with an ISO 17025 Quality Assurance Program. The purpose of a quality assurance program is to assure that all laboratory testing is performed according to the principles of current good laboratory practises. In other words, a quality system of management controls for the laboratory to ensure the uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality, and integrity of documentation and test results. Accreditation makes a huge difference in quality control and analyst competency. All of our analysts are rigorously proficiency tested by CALA to check for precision and accuracy."

You may purchase one from most hardwareor safety supply stores.\n\nTo submit samples on your own, insert one sample into a sealed and labeled Ziploc bag. Depending on the material type, acceptable sample quantity should not be larger than a fist and can be as small as 2 square inches. Drywall samples should be submitted with presence of joint compound or mud. Please collect your sample at a joint or seam.\n\nVermiculite samples however are an exception and the recommended quantity is a medium Ziploc freezer bag, with an emphasis on collecting the fine particulate dust that settles on the floor.\n\nLabel the bags with permanent marker with the following information: address, location collected (bathroom wall, kitchen ceiling, garage floor, attic, etc.), type of material (floor tile, texture coat, joint compound, insulation, etc.) collection date and the sample number in the order you wish the samples to be reported.\n\nYou may drop off your samples in person at our lab (Monday to Friday 8: 30 to 4: 00pm). You must first complete a Chain of Custody Form which records important information such as the number of samples, the type of material, location of samples taken, current date, signatures and requested turnaround time for results. Samples will not be analysed without a completed Chain of Custody. Please ensure it accompanies your delivery. Pre-Payment is required upon submission and we accept all major credit cards."
